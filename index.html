 <p>Security has become a prime concern in recent years. As the technology is emerging every second, abundant microcontroller based security
    systems have been developing and implementing with many modern features to keep the place safe. This
    paper presents design and prototype implementation of a smart security system that makes place security more convenient, flexible, and less expensive. The system is
    based on microcontroller, which assists in ensuring residential security. This system includes a PIR sensor, a
    sim card, a microcontroller (ATmega328), a flame detection sensor (KY-026), a SIM800L GSM module, a
    flammable gas sensor (MQ-2) and a mobile consisting of SMS application which readily endow the users the
    ability to receive SMS from anywhere via the cellular network. This system also provides an alarm facility as well as led to ensure its working.</p><br>
  <p>Modern complex home security systems include several security features like fire, intruders, electronic door lock, heat, smoke, temperature, etc. Some security systems may be a combination of all the security measures.</p><br>
  <img src="smart security system diagram.jpg" alt="smart security system diagram" width="600px" height="450px" class="center"><br>
  <p>Such complex systems may be expensive and may not be affordable by everyone. There are individual security systems based on the requirement.</p><br>
  <p>In this project, we designed a simple but very efficient home security that has a function of sending SMS to the homeowner on his/her mobile number in case of an intruder alert.</p><br>
  <p>The project is based on Arduino, PIR motion detection sensor, Flame Sensor, Smoke Sensor and GSM Module.</p><br>
  <h2>Circuit Diagram</h2>
  <p>The circuit diagram of smart security system is shown in given below. Arduino UNO board consist of ATmega328P microcontroller. It is important component of Arduino board. In this other components are present like flammable gas sensor, flame
    sensor, PIR motion sensor, GSM module, breadboard, LEDs and buzzer.</p><br>

  <h2>Hardware Required</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3">Arduino Uno</a></li>
    <li>SIM800L GSM Module</li>
    <li>PIR Motion Sensor</li>
    <li>KY-026 Flame Sensor</li>
    <li>MQ-2 Smoke Sensor</li>
    <li>Breadboard</li>
    <li>Buzzer</li>
    <li>LED</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Wiring up the Components</h2>
  <p>This step in the build process is to make the necessary connections using long connecting wires as per the circuit diagram and securing these wires so that they don’t hang around. The MQ-2 gas sensor’s analog output (AO) pin is connected to
    analog pin A5. Anode terminal of GAS LED1, GAS LED2 and GAS Buzzer pins are connected to digital pin D7, D6, D8 respectively and VCC is connected to +5V and GND and cathode is connected to ground pin of Arduino board. All the wires from the
    components are connected to respective pins of Arduino. This finishes up the build process of the Smart Security System. In Arduino code has been uploaded.</p>
  <p>OUT pin of PIR motion sensor is connected to digital pin D11. Anode terminal of PIR LED1, PIR LED2 and PIR Buzzer pins are connected to digital pin D3, D13, D12 respectively and VCC is connected to +5V and GND and cathode is connected to ground
    pin of Arduino board.</p>
  <p>Analog output (AO) of KY-026 flame sensor pin is connected to analog pin A2. Anode terminal of FLAME LED1, FLAME LED2 and FLAME Buzzer pins are connected to digital pin D2, D5, D4 respectively and VCC is connected to +5V and GND and cathode is
    connected to ground pin of Arduino board.</p>
  <p>Now we need to connect SIM800L GSM module to Arduino board so we have connected TXD and RXD pin to digital pins D9 and D10 respectively. VCC connected to +5V and VCC to ground of Arduino board. Hence, GSM module is used to send SMS on registered
    mobile number.</p><br>
  <p>All the wires from the components are connected to respective pins of Arduino. This finishes up the build process of the Smart Security System. In Arduino code has been uploaded.</p>
  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p> SMART SECURITY SYSTEM is an IOT based project. Here we are using Arduino for code execution, for sensing we used flammable gas sensor (MQ-2), flame detection sensor (KY-026) and PIR motion sensor which will send respectively analog, digital and
    analog data to Arduino board and after that GSM module sends SMS on registered mobile number. It is a microcontroller based security system so it would be easy to install suitable place.</p>
  <p>Our aim is also to make it cost effective so that many number of people can get the benefit from this. And it should be usable to anyone and helpful for them. To complete our product, we require some software as well as some hardware.</p><br>
  <h2>Component Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <h3>Arduino UNO</h3>
    <p>Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins, 6 analog inputs, a USB connection, a power jack, and a reset button.</p><br>
    <img src="arduinounor3.png" alt="Arduino UNO" width="400px" height="300px" class="center"><br>
    <p>It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller, simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.</p><br>
    <h3>PIR Motion Sensor</h3>
    <p>PIR sensors allow you to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the sensors range.</p><br>
    <img src="pirsensor.png" alt="PIR Motion Sensor" width="350" height="300" class="center"><br><br>
    <p>They are small, inexpensive, low-power, easy to use and don't wear out. For that reason they are commonly found in appliances and gadgets used in homes or businesses.</p>
    <h3>Smoke Sensor</h3>
    <p>This flammable gas and smoke sensor detects the concentrations of ombustible gas in the air and outputs its reading as an analog voltage.</p><br>
    <img src="gas.png" alt="MQ-2 Flammable gas and smoke sensor" width="300" height="300" class="center"><br><br>
    <h3>KY-026 Flame Sensor</h3>
    <p>KY-026 Flame Sensor module for Arduino detects infrared light emitted by fire.</p><br>
    <img src="flame.png" alt="KY-026 Flame Sensor" width="300" height="400" class="center"><br>
    <p>The module has both digital and analog outputs and a potentiometer to adjust the sensitivity. Commonl used in fire detection systems.</p><br>
    <h3>SIM800L GSM Module</h3>
    <p>SIM800L GSM/GPRS module is a miniature GSM modem, which can be integrated into a great number of IoT projects.</p><br>
    <img src="sim800l.png" alt="SIM800L GSM Module" class="center"><br>
    <p>You can use this module to accomplish almost anything a normal cell phone can send text messages, Make or receive phone calls, connecting to internet through GPRS, TCP/IP, and more! To top it off, the module supports quad-band GSM/GPRS
      network, meaning it works pretty much anywhere the world.</p><br>
  </ul>
  <h2>Working of Smart Security System</h2>
  <p>Home Security Alarm Systems are very important in present day society, where crime is increasing. With the technological advancements we have achieved in the recent years, a homeowner doesn’t have to worry about home security while getting off
    his/her home.</p>
  <p>Modern home security systems provide enough security from burglars, fire, smoke, etc. They also provide immediate notification to the homeowner.</p>
  <p>The working of the project is explained below.</p>
  <p>First we need to give power supply to the system using the 5V adapter and then insert sim card in the SIM800L module and wait until it get the network. To check network detect led of GSM module start blinking of the delay of 3 seconds. Now the
    smart security system is ready to work. If system detects any flammable gas it sends a SMS on our mobile phone containing text “Gas Leakage alert” and blue led is start glowing and buzzer also starts producing sound. And when the PIR motion
    sensor detects motion it send a SMS containing text “Motion Detected!” and green led is start glowing and buzzer also start producing sound. And when the flame sensor detects flame it send a SMS containing text “Fire Detected!” and the red led is
    start glowing and the buzzer also start producing sound.</p><br>
